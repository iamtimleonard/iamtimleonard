# Hello! I am Tim Leonard

I am a full stack engineer at [epoxy.ai](epoxy.ai), where I help create personalization tools for sports betting operators. Feel free to look around at my public repos.

I'm currently solving the [cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/) challenges using [Go](https://github.com/iamtimleonard/cryptopals) and blogging about it on my portfolio. I'm also working on a data visualization project using Next.js and D3 to explore how music venues have changed over time in my home city of Philadelphia. You can take it for a spin [here](https://venue-project-beryl.vercel.app/). Let me know if you have an feature requests!

My portfolio project is mostly a public playground for me to try out different frontend ideas. My most recent experiment was the neon lettering with glowing animation.
