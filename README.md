# Hello! I am Tim Leonard

I have been learning web development with chingu.io, where I get paired with other developers to create apps as part of a remote team. Being part of self-directed projects like this has helped me get comfortable integrating unfamiliar technologies into my code and engage with project management techniques like the Agile Methodology. I also started contributing to open source projects and am always on the lookout for more ways I can interface with the web development community.

## My Projects

You can see examples of static sites I made [here](https://fementor-blogr.vercel.app/) and [here](https://fementor-project-tracking-iamtimleonard.vercel.app/).

1. [College Football Scores Search](https://football-app.iamtimleonard.vercel.app/)

   - Pure HTML, CSS, JS, this was my first foray into asynchronous code. This was also a first lesson in Single Responsibility: the JS quickly became unweildy and needed a lot of comments to be understandable. The app works, though!

2. [Border Radius Preview App](https://border-radius.iamtimleonard.vercel.app/)

   - I tried to push myself to use a more organized approach to the project by making an object to control the inputs and allow me to apply a goofy dancing method to shape.

3. [Trivia Quiz App](https://quiz-app-iamtimleonard.vercel.app/)

   - Learning the lessons from the football app, I split up responsibilities in my codebase, making a class to for the full quiz and another class for individual questions. This kept index.js much more manageable and self-documenting.

4. [MessageMe](https://messageme.vercel.app/)

   - A simple messaging app

5. [Poll App](https://poll-time-iamtimleonard.herokuapp.com/)
   - My first MERN app.
