# Hello! I am Tim Leonard

I am a full stack engineer at [epoxy.ai](epoxy.ai), where I help create personalization tools for sports betting operators. Feel free to look around at my public repos.

osme is my current project. It will be a perfume library and tracker for users to keep track of what scents they wear and own. My wife is a UX magician and she created the original designs for the app as part of her bootcamp work. It has a long way to go but it will eventually include social features and image recognition.

My portfolio project is mostly a sort of public playground for me to try out different frontend ideas. My most recent experiment was the neon lettering with glowing animation.
